对于低年级的孩子来说，就是输入问题是一个麻烦事儿，还有呢，出现了问题的答案之后，他不会读，又是一个麻烦事儿，所以这个基本上他是自己不能使用

Solutions to the Problems in the README
Based on the problems identified in the README:
Young children have difficulty inputting questions
They struggle to read the answers
I've implemented the following solutions:
1. Speech Input for Question Asking
I've added a voice recognition feature that allows children to:
Click on a microphone button to speak their questions instead of typing
The speech is automatically converted to text and placed in the input field
This removes the barrier of having to type questions
2. Text-to-Speech for Answer Reading
I've implemented several features to help children understand answers:
Automatic Text-to-Speech: When an answer appears, it is automatically read aloud in Chinese
Manual Text-to-Speech: Each answer has a speaker button that can be clicked to have the answer read aloud again
Font Size Adjustment: An "A/A+/A++" button at the top of the interface allows children to increase the text size for easier reading
Clear Visual Styling: The existing interface with its child-friendly design and icons helps make the experience engaging
Additional Benefits
The app now supports a fully voice-based interaction where children can:
Speak their question
Have the answer read back to them
No typing or reading required
The interface maintains its child-friendly design with emojis and animations
All text in buttons and interfaces remains in Chinese to match the target audience
These changes make the application accessible to younger children who struggle with typing and reading, allowing them to use the app independently.
